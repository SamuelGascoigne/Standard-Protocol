"Timestamp","How many years have MPMs been involved in your research?","You are comfortable at building stage-structured population models (i.e., MPMs or IPMs).","Population ecologists who use MPMs describe the methods associated with building the MPMs from raw data adequately for reproducibility in peer-reviewed publications.","Papers using MPMs identify and clearly define the names of stage/age/size classes used in their structure. ","Census duration, the period of time data are recorded (e.g., 6 months, 10 years), is reported with the MPMs in peer-reviewed publications.","Projection interval, the period of time between censuses (e.g., 3 months, 1 year), is reported with the MPMs in peer-reviewed publications.","Authors detail the formulas used to calculate vital rates (i.e., attributions from survival, sexual reproduction, clonal reproduction, retrogression towards a single matrix element) in peer-reviewed publications.","The life-cycle graph, which illustrates the discrete transitions involved in an MPM, is present in peer-reviewed publications using MPMs.","Population vectors, which define the structure of the population, are explicitly reported in peer-reviewed publications using MPMs.","Papers using MPMs display the MPM in a table or in the supplementary information. ","Given the current state of peer-reviewed publication practice around MPMs, I think a standardized method of MPM reporting is necessary for the coherent communication of MPMs in the literature."
